Week 1 assignment

For this project I believe I have achieved the main objectives of the assignment plus also a few of the stretch requirements. These include a back to top button in the footer, internal links and smooth scrolling, and hover effects on the buttons.

I have not managed to create links in the footer for social media pages and I have not managed to add a background music track to the webpage as I have ran out of time. I am happy with my overall submission and have added google fonts to the code to make it look more professional. I found this assignment quite enjoyable for the most part. The main issues that I faced mainly had to do with flexbox and positioning. I also had trouble initially with my background images being bigger than the rest of the page. 

Overall I am pleased with the submission and have enjoyed doing the project.
